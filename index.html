      <b>Common Dental Problems During Pregnancy</b>
        <ul><li>Plaque </li> </ul>
        <p>
        Also known as pregnancy gingivitis or gum disease, this usually happens during the second trimester where your gums may be more sensitive, leading to bleeding and inflammation. This can cause swelling in your gums when you brush your teeth or when flossing.
      </p>

      <ul><li>Periodontitis</li></ul>
      <p>
        This gum infection can put you at risk of tooth decay, making your teeth shaky to the point of those affected fall off if left untreated. From the increase of estrogen and progesterone in your body due to pregnancy, this could destroy the supporting bone structure around your teeth.
      </p>

      <ul><li>Pregnancy Epulis</li></ul>
      <p>
        Another gum disease, pregnancy epulis or pyogenic granuloma can cause a localised enlargement of the gum that makes it bleed easily. 
        According to <a href="https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/HealthyLiving/pregnancy-and-teeth">Better Health</a>,
         it is advised that you get a professional cleaning to treat this dental problem.

        During pregnancy, it’s not enough to purchase a toothpaste that promises the best results. Most toothpaste products include bad chemicals that could be harmful to you and your baby.

        Be mindful of the ingredients lists on your toothpaste for these components, especially sodium lauryl sulfate, are still often being used despite their dangerous effects. It may even best to avoid these products altogether and purchase ones that do not include any
